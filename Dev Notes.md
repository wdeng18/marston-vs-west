# Dev Notes 
This is meant to be a record of ideas and issues we need to implement for the game for the future, or issues we need to address

## General code & Logic
- Event timers 
- Timer class, can call an animation event,
when animation plays, trigger other code, in eventcomplete(do other stuff)
- Making actual input handled as method of fighter class Fighter.punch 
- Passable timers
- Keyboard inputs, virtual buttons (no downduration) update controller class

## Combat Logic
- Hit stun, diminish returns
- third hit does a launch (combo system?)
- Implement a queue or linked list for attack combos,
- On time presses 
- FrameBuffer
- Roman cancel
- Gameplay testing, breath system or launch combos, different ways of escaping combos 
- ### Combat ideas resources
	- 

# Art
- We need strong silhouettes for fighters (makes characters easy to see and read
- ### Attack animations needed
	- Windup Frames (pre attack, arm moving back, etc)
	- Attack Frames (Fighter is now actually attacking)
	- Recovery Frames (Attack is over, returning back to idle, Arm is being pulled back)
